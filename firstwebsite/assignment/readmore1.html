        There are three main types of mountains: volcanic, fold, and block.[17] All three types are formed from plate
        tectonics: when portions of the Earth's crust move, crumple, and dive. Compressional forces, isostatic uplift
        and intrusion of igneous matter forces surface rock upward, creating a landform higher than the surrounding
        features. The height of the feature makes it either a hill or, if higher and steeper, a mountain. Major
        mountains tend to occur in long linear arcs, indicating tectonic plate boundaries and activity.</p>
